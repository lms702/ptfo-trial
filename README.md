Welcome to my repo! This is the code that I wrote for the TrojanHacks Spring 2019 Hackathon.
It is a database manager written in python that manages requests sent to the server that we set up for our project. 
The server contains information about the printers on campus and receives requests to edit the data from mobile devices
with the app that my team and I built.
